# Chat-Application
 This program is an online chat application that can run on mobile and desktop. It is designed using Socket Programming. 
 The program consists of two parts, server and client. By establishing a connection with the client server, it is used to transfer the messages of the user to the server and at the same time to receive these messages from the server. Although unnecessary, Swing is used in the server part and JavaFx is used in the client part.
